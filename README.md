# Repository Information

This purpose of this repository is to store all the images, annotations and videos that were used to develop the License Plate Detection and Recognition (LPDR) System.

## The Detection Stage

The "Detection Stage" directory contains  the images and xml and txt annotations for training the machine learning model to detect the license plates from an image. The data is split into local license plates and foreign license plates.

## The Recognition Stage

The "Recognition Stage" directory contains the Chars74K dataset which was used to train the recognition machine learning model to recognize characters segmented from a license plate. The dataset contains images for the letters A-Z and numbers 0-9.

## System Accuracy Testing

The system accuracy testing contains images of a vehicle captured at different distances and angles. These images were used to test how accurate the system is in detecting and recognizing license plates and their characters under varying conditions.

## System Speed Testing

The system speed testing contains videos that were used to test the speed performance of the system. These videos were used to test how fast the system can process each frame of the video to determine if the system is suitable for a real-world application.
